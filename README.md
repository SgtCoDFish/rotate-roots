# Rotate Roots Right Round

This repo is a companion to my KubeCon EU 2023 talk, [Rotate Roots Right Round: Using cert-manager for Safer Private PKI](https://kccnceu2023.sched.com/event/1HyZ6).

It provides example configuration and steps for setting up private PKI in Kubernetes using:

1. cert-manager (of course!)
2. [approver-policy](https://cert-manager.io/docs/projects/approver-policy/)
3. and [trust-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/projects/trust-manager/)

Subfolders are numbered in order; follow them in numerical order.

Using this repo, along with the talk, you should be able to safely set up a private PKI that's free of cost, free of rate limits and which gives you complete control!
